1. **You**: Explain the following code in detail: 
```python
print(f"{Fore.WHITE}{Back.BLACK}[FUNCTION] {func.__name__.replace('_', ' ').title()} - STARTED")
```
2. **ChatGPT**: This code is written in Python and uses the `print` function to display a formatted string. Let's break it down step by step:

1. `Fore.WHITE` and `Back.BLACK` are part of the `colorama` library, which provides cross-platform support for colored text in the terminal. These represent the foreground (text) color and background color, respectively.

2. The string that is being printed is enclosed in curly braces `{}`. This is known as an f-string, which allows us to embed expressions inside curly braces to be evaluated and formatted as part of the string.

3. The expression `func.__name__.replace('_', ' ').title()` is used to retrieve the name of a function and modify it for display. 

   - `func` is assumed to be a function object.
   - `__name__` is a special attribute of a function object that stores its name as a string.
   - `replace('_', ' ')` replaces underscores with spaces in the function name.
   - `title()` capitalizes the first letter of each word in the modified name.

4. The resulting modified function name is then concatenated with other parts of the string. The final string displayed by `print` will include the text `[FUNCTION]` followed by the modified function name.

Overall, this code is used as a logging mechanism to display a message indicating the start of a specific function. The message includes the name of the function, with underscores replaced by spaces and each word capitalized, and is displayed with white text on a black background.
